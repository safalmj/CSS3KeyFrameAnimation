CSS3 animations are the new kid on the block. It’s a big step. Although they haven’t really taken centre stage yet as only the webkit browsers support them.

For this reason they’re used sparingly, in a lot of cases for experimental purposes or as ‘hidden gems’, but that doesn’t mean you should shy away from getting stuck in.

It was only recently I experimented myself so I thought I’d share a beginner’s demo with you.



More CSS3 animation properties

This is a very simple example I have used here, and is just to help beginners get started.

For the -webkit-animation property, there are a number of other values you can try:

    -webkit-animation-name: [any name you like];
    -webkit-animation-iteration-count: [number, infinite];
    -webkit-animation-timing-function: [linear, ease,ease-in, ease-out];
    -webkit-animation-duration: [time];
    -webkit-animation-delay: [time];

For the @-webkit-keyframes rule, instead of using percentage as keyframes, we can also declare a from and to state. You can also make it transform while animating.

@-webkit-keyframes movingbox{
from{left:90%;-webkit-transform: rotate(0deg);}
to{left:10%;-webkit-transform: rotate(360deg);}
}
